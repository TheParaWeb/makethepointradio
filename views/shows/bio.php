                <p><span class="bold">Keven Cohen</span> is a 25 year veteran of talk radio. Born in Detroit, Michigan, he started his radio journey in Gainesville, Florida. Kev moved to Columbia in the summer of 1994 planning on a short stay before leaving for a bigger market. First, he fell in love with Columbia; then, he fell in love with a Columbia girl.</p>
                <p>Add it up and Kev has spent 19 years doing talk radio in the Capital City. 13 of those years were spent as host of "The Afternoon Drive with Kev." He also served as host of The 5th Quarter Postgame Show following University of South Carolina football games for 19 seasons. Many people won't remember this but Keven actually first arrived in Columbia doing the morning sports. Now, he's back to setting the alarm early as host of "Mornings with Keven Cohen."</p>
                <p>Community and military support have been focal points for Keven both publicly and privately. He has hosted 13 "Radiothons" for the South Carolina Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, raising over $1.1 million dollars for children with blood cancers. He's heavily-committed to the U.S. military and works closely with charities such as The Welcome Home Project, Hidden Wounds, Operation Thank you and others.</p>
                <p>Keven and his wife (hero) Laney have two wonderful children. They live in the Harbison area. Email Keven at <a href="mailto:kev@makethepointradio.com">kev@makethepointradio.com</a>.</p>
